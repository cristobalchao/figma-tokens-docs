# Figma Tokens

**Figma Tokens** is a [Figma Plugin](https://jansix.at/resources/figma-tokens) allowing you to integrate Tokens into your Figma designs.

It gives you reusable tokens that can be used for a whole range of design options, from border radius or spacer units to semantic color and typography styles. It allows you to change tokens and see these changes applied to the whole document or its styles.
